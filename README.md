## Technical details

The game is built using Kotlin, to compile it yourself, simply clone the repository, open it in Android
Studio and build away.

There are two flavours: `full` and `lite`. The `full` flavour contains all images as part of the
application, that allows it to be fully offline at the cost of larger file sizes for updates. The
`lite` version does not contain any packs built-in and lets you download those that you want, meaning
it needs access to internet, but the update size is smaller.
