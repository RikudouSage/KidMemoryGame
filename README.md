## Technical details

The game is built using Kotlin, to compile it yourself, simply clone the repository, open it in Android
Studio and build away.

There are two flavours: `full` and `lite`. The `full` flavour contains all images as part of the
application, that allows it to be fully offline at the cost of larger file sizes for updates. The
`lite` version does not contain any packs built-in and lets you download those that you want, meaning
it needs access to internet, but the update size is smaller.

## Plugins (Theme Packs)

The app supports third-party theme packs, allowing you to create and install your own custom themes. Once installed, the app will automatically discover them.

A detailed guide is on the way, but hereâ€™s a quick overview of how to integrate your theme pack:

### How it works
- Your app (the plugin) needs to respond to a broadcast intent with the action:  
  `cz.chrastecky.kidsmemorygame.REQUEST_THEME_INFO`
- In response, you should provide a **Content Provider** that can handle query requests and return two key properties:
    - `basePath`: A full URI (as a string) pointing to the **directory containing the root `themes.json`** file.
    - `packageId`: Your appâ€™s Android package ID.

### Required Files
- **themes.json** (root file):
    - This file lists all available theme packs provided by your plugin.
    - Its format should match this app's [themes.json](themes/themes.json).
    - All properties are required, except for `hash`.

- **theme.json** (per theme pack):
    - Each theme pack should have its own `theme.json` file describing the theme's assets.
    - You can use the [sea pack theme.json](themes/sea/theme.json) as an example.
    - All properties are required, except for `mascots` and `hash`.

### Security Considerations

For better security, both the **broadcast receiver** and the **content provider** can require the following permission to interact with the memory game app:

```
cz.chrastecky.kidsmemorygame.PERMISSION_REQUEST_THEMES
```


This ensures that only trusted apps can respond to theme requests or provide theme data.
